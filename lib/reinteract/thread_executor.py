# to set an exception asynchronously on another thread. To keep it out of

# through pthreads.

_PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc = ctypes.pythonapi.PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc

#
# _PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc won't immediately wake up a thread that is blocking
# in a syscall, so we also send a Unix signal to hopefully wake such a thread
# up. (This can be foiled if the syscall is called within C code that catches
# EINTR and restarts. In that case, we have no way of killing the thread without
# breaking Python internal state so we don't try.)
#
# To make sending a signal wake the thread up out of the syscall without killing
# the thread, we need a non-default no-op handler for the signal. The slightly
# tricky thing about what we do is that signal.signal() is defined to affect only
# the main thread, but the way it does it is set up a handler for all threads and
# then ignore the signal in all but the main thread. So, our ignore_handler is
# never called, but Python's handler does what we wanted to do (ignore the signal)
# anyways.
